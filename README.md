# Jump in Data Analytics.

Welcome to my Data Analytics first repo.

## __Short description
In the end of 2023 I've decided to change my life and drop civil engineering business and jump into IT. After learning basics of Python, Git, Github, MySQL I've decided to follow Data Analytics path.
This is my first portfolio project in SQL Server done with the help of FreeCodeCamp.org and analystbuilder.com bootcamp.

In this 01 project I analyze data related to COVID-19, clean up data set related to Nashville Housing Market and create project in Excel with pivot tables and dashboard.

If you have any remarks I'll be appreciate for comments and some dose of constructive criticism ;)

BR,
Piotr
